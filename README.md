# Aleo & Blast Blockchain Analysis Dashboard

This project showcases an analytical dashboard created using Flipside, where two blockchains, **Aleo** and **Blast**, are compared across multiple key metrics:

- **User Growth**  
- **DeFi Activity**  
- **Transaction Size**  
- **Transaction Frequency**  

## ðŸ“Š Dashboard Overview

The [dashboard](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/akpan_einstein_28/comparative-analysis-between-aleo-and-blast-sXTX2O) provides insights into the performance and activity levels of the Aleo and Blast blockchains, making it easier to:

1. Visualize growth trends.
2. Compare decentralized finance (DeFi) interactions.
3. Analyze the average transaction size.
4. Review transaction frequency over time.
